<p>
    American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
    credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891
    until his death in 1911 that he invented it.
    The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman,
    a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
